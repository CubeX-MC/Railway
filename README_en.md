## Plugin Overview

Metro is a subway transit system plugin that lets administrators create automated subway lines and provides players with a convenient riding experience, inspired by Newnan.city. The repository is a single-module Maven project targeting Java 17 and 1.18+ servers, with Paper/Folia compatibility logic included.

## Basic Concepts

* **Line**: Defines a subway route by an ordered list of stops.  
* **Stop**: A station area in the world, defined by two corner points.  
* **StopPoint**: A powered rail within a Stop where players right-click to board a minecart.  
* **Transfer**: Connections from one Stop to other Lines for route changes.

## Quick Start

### Create Your First Line

1. `/m line create line1 Line 1`  
2. `/m line setcolor line1 &9`  
3. `/m line setterminus line1 East Terminus`

### Create a Stop

1. `/m stop create station1 Central Station`  
2. With the golden hoe, left/right click to mark the two corners of the station area  
3. Run `/m stop setcorners station1` to apply the selection  
4. On the powered rail, run `/m stop setpoint`  
5. `/m line addstop line1 station1`

### Player Usage

Players right-click the powered rail inside a Stop to summon and board a minecart. The system will handle travel, stops, and arrivals automatically.

## Permissions

| Permission         | Default | Description                                      |
| :----------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `metro.admin`      | OP      | Allows use of all admin commands, including teleport access |
| `metro.use`        | Everyone | Allows players to use the subway system         |
| `metro.gui`        | Everyone | Allows players to open `/m gui`; visible actions are filtered by permission |
| `metro.tp`         | false   | Allows players to teleport to stops through commands and the GUI |
| `metro.line.create`| false   | Allows players to create new lines               |
| `metro.stop.create`| false   | Allows players to create new stops               |
| `metro.portal.create`| false | Allows players to create minecart portals         |

## Ownership & Permission Flow

* Newly created lines/stops/portals record the creator as owner and add them to the admin list.
* `/m line trust/untrust/owner`, `/m stop trust/untrust/owner`, and `/m portal trust/untrust/owner` manage who can edit each resource.
* `/m stop link allow/deny` controls which lines are whitelisted to use a stop; line admins must obtain authorization before running `/m line addstop`.
* Portals can exist independently; line admins use `/m line addportal/delportal` to control whether a line can use a portal.
* Legacy data without ownership entries is treated as server-owned and can only be modified by OPs or players with `metro.admin`.

## Configuration Files

* `config.yml` – Global settings (display templates, sounds, minecart behavior)  
* `lines.yml` – Line definitions and ordering  
* `stops.yml` – Stop definitions and properties  
* `zh_CN.yml` – Chinese language file  

## Build Targets

- **Build the plugin**: `mvn clean package`
  - Produces `target/metro-<version>.jar`
  - The current version comes from `pom.xml`, for example `target/metro-1.1.7.jar`

The repository is now a single-module Maven project targeting Java 17 and 1.18+ servers, with Paper/Folia compatibility logic included.
